TEAM_ID=<Token1> 
ACCESS_TOKEN=<Token2>
MILVUS_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:19530

## Quick start

For interact with a bot follow the steps:
1. Open telegram and find @NRBWBA_bot or follow the [link](https://t.me/NRBWBA_bot)
2. Click `Start` or run `/start` command for activation
3. To use bots services follow its individual guides: Notion, TeamFlame, GitFlame

## Example of interaction with [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product)

### 1. Create a note

User send a message to the bot in the format:

```
Create a note {note_name} {note_content}
```

If there is no title for the note, but there is content, the title will be generated based on the text of the note. Also the approximate content for the note will be generated based on it's title if content is absent.

### 5. Find answer to question in notes
User send a message to the bot in the format:

```
{question}
```

RAG system analyse all notes and gives context (the most useful information for answering this question). Then context and user request goes to AI module and then to LLM which gives answer to the question if it can be found in context or answers "no information" otherwise.

### 6. Summarize the note
User send a message to the bot in the format:


```
Summarize the text of the {note_name}
```

Further embedder finds the desired note by key words of it's name. Then the content of this note goes into AI module and LLM that shortens the note and gives the short form to the user in bot. **(In progress)**
